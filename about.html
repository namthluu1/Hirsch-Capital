    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We simulate real-world investment management by running a student-operated portfolio, researching public equities, and presenting investment theses.
      Members undergo training in financial modeling, industry analysis, and macroeconomic research.
      We also host workshops, speaker events, and collaboration projects that deepen studentsâ€™ understanding of capital markets and prepare them for careers in finance.
